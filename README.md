### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name's **Adrian ZapaÅ‚a**.

I'm a computer scientist (informatics, computer engineering). I'm interested especially in:
- programming,
- computer networks,
- number theory (prime numbers),
- cryptology.

Besides this I'm interested in:

- space engineering.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on prime numbers theorem with programming.
